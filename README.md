# tina
your mutual friend helping you make meaningful connections
Dating apps have failed. They have a blank screen in front of the two people and the onus is on the two strangers to come up with something interesting to talk about. Even if the conversation manages to begin, it is lost over time. The success rates of dating apps is only falling.

Enter tina. An intelligent, trained mutual friend who knows the people in the conversation before-hand, and does near human perfect introductions. 

## What are the characterstics of a great conversation ?
* Reveals only limited information
* discovers common ground but naturally
  * Common ground should be nuanced and not simply surface level likes and dislikes.
* closed ended
* knows when the next conversation will happen
* Two people remaining in a conversation for more than 10 minutes continuously have a better chance of being friends than staggered conversations
* Something common to talk about
